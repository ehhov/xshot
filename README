xshot - screenshot utility for X
================================

This program is based on a few projects:
 - scrot (https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/scrot)
 - xscreenshot (https://git.codemadness.org/xscreenshot/log.html)
 - farbfeld (https://git.suckless.org/farbfeld/log.html)

In fact, it is something like a stripped down to my personal needs 
scrot with some additional functionality. It is slower, but has fewer 
dependencies. It can
 - capture all monitors,
 - capture a single monitor
    - identified by the pointer location,
    - identified by the active window position,
 - capture the current active window,
 - select a region to capture
    - select by dragging,
    - select by two clicks,
 - freeze the screen so that compositors don't override the selection 
   rectangle and it does not disappear (of course you can unfreeze it),
 - exclude window borders and decorations,
 - capture windows as you see them (include transparency and so on),
 - capture after a delay with millisecond precision.


Requirements
------------
To build this program, Xlib and Xrandr are needed.
