xshot - screenshot utility for X
================================

xshot is a (slower, but) lightweight screenshot utility aimed at 
providing all necessary and useful features while having as few 
dependencies as possible. It is written in pure Xlib with the use of 
Xrandr extension for single monitor capturing.

Like most of the other screenshot utilities, xshot can capture all 
monitors, single monitor, windows (with and without decorations), and 
regions.

This program is based on a few projects:
 - scrot (https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/scrot)
 - xscreenshot (https://git.codemadness.org/xscreenshot/log.html)
 - farbfeld (https://git.suckless.org/farbfeld/log.html)
